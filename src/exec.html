						<h3 class="text-center">Members of the Executive Advisory Board</h3><br>
						<p>
							<strong>Dr. Erin Boynton (Board Chair)</strong> is an Orthopaedic surgeon, sports
							doctor,
							and past-chair of the research committee for the Canadian Orthopaedic
							Foundation. She was the chief orthopaedic surgeon and consultant to the Toronto Blue
							Jays,
							Toronto Maple Leafs and the
							Toronto Argos. She is the first female orthopaedic surgeon to work with the MLB and NHL
							and
							is the current Medical
							Director for the Rogers Cup WTA tennis tour event in Toronto. Dr. Boynton's role on the
							Executive Advisory Board is
							crucial as she provides the Executive Committee useful insight regarding ways the UOTC
							can
							improve its training methods
							during practices in order to improve and optimise the overall health of its athletes.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Mr. Alan Cohen</strong> is a practising lawyer who was a sessional lecturer at
							the
							University of Ottawa's Faculty of Law for 13 years, leading a
							course in Municipal and Land Use Planning Law. Alan is a life-long tennis player with a
							love
							of the game that far
							exceeds his talent, but which will allow him to assist the UOTC Executive Committee in
							putting together various
							documents for administrative use and to advise on any organisational decisions.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Dr. Alireza Jalali</strong> is the Head of the Division of Anatomy, and the
							Interim
							Assistant Dean, External Relations at Faculty of Medicine,
							uOttawa. He has a Medical Doctorate and a Specialist Diploma in Sports Medicine from the
							University of Liège in Belgium.
							Since coming to the Faculty of Medicine in 2003, he has been teaching Anatomy
							passionately.
							He has developed an active
							research program in Educational Innovations use and usefulness: Podcasts, YouTube, TBL,
							Social Media, and 3D printing.
							Dr. Jalali also has an established track record of Leadership: UGME Unit Leader,
							Director of
							Practical exams and Social
							Media Advisor at Royal College. He has received numerous awards, including the 2020
							University of Ottawa Teacher of the
							Year award. Dr. Jalali's experience in leadership and problem-solving is beneficial for
							the
							President of the UOTC. He
							can provide suggestions on how to tackle both administrative, and social-related
							problems
							the UOTC may face in the
							future.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Dr. Cameron Montgomery</strong> is a professor in the Faculty of Education at
							the
							University of Ottawa. Dr. Montgomery was a former Progressive
							Conservative Candidate for riding in Orleans. He continues to regularly play and enjoy
							the
							sport of tennis. Having
							significant experience with fundraising and attention building, Dr. Montgomery’s role on
							the
							board will help both
							Marketing and Communications Executives in approaching new sponsors, and growing our
							fundraising outreach.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Mrs. Julie Smyth</strong> is a tennis enthusiast and member of the Rockcliffe
							Lawn
							Tennis Club (RLTC) in Ottawa. She has played and followed
							tennis for more than 30 years and is an active member of the Ottawa tennis community.
							Julie
							is a volunteer executive
							member of the RLTC Board of Directors, serving as Secretary. She was part of the Board
							in
							2020 as the club navigated a
							challenging but successful reopening during the COVID-19 pandemic. As well as being an
							active member of the Board, Julie
							looks after RLTC's social media and helps with adult programming. She also took on the
							role
							of welcoming new members to
							the club and attends National Capital Tennis Association (NCTA) AGMs on behalf of RLTC.
							Julie has degrees in business
							and journalism, both from Ryerson University, and is a professional writer and editor.
							For
							more than two decades, she
							worked as a reporter at leading national newspapers in Canada and Scotland, then worked
							as a
							freelance writer, federal government speechwriter and marketing content creator. She has
							two
							teenagers, one
							of whom plays tennis. Her experience regarding board leadership and social media
							platform
							management is extremely
							beneficial for the UOTC; especially the Communications Executive.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Mr. Marinus Wins</strong> is the Treasurer for the National Capital Tennis
							Association (NCTA), the governing body regulating tennis in Ottawa. He
							is a member of the Athletics Wall of Fame for tennis at Carleton University. He was a
							member
							of Carleton University's
							tennis team which twice won the team championships of the Ontario Quebec Athletic
							Association (OQAA). Currently retired,
							he enjoys playing tennis as much as he can. His experience with being a treasurer and
							handling money for a large
							tennis-related association will be beneficial in providing insight regarding budgeting,
							fees, expenses, and other
							suggestions to the UOTC; especially to the Treasurer of the UOTC.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Mr. Max Zimmerman</strong> is a graduate of the Honours program in
							Communications at

							of six and played competitively in Ontario as a junior, reaching a ranking of 8th in the
							province back in 2007. His
							favourite shots are the backhand down the line and drop shot. Max was also the former
							Marketing Executive of the UOTC
							for two years. Max's position on the board is beneficial for aiding the current
							Marketing
							Executive with different ideas
							for fundraising and clinic events.
						</p>
						<p><strong>Mrs. Rachel Gould</strong> represents the various Canadian University Tennis
							teams at
							Tennis Canada in the Development Department. An avid fan and
