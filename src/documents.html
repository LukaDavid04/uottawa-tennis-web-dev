					<h3 class="text-center">Division One Player Commitment Policy</h3>
					<br>
					<h5>Committing to the Division 1 Tennis Team</h5>
					<p>Tennis players selected to play in the top division, division 1, of university tennis for the
						University of Ottawa Tennis Club (UOTC) are competitive, hard-working, and motivated players.
						Tennis players who accept this position must make a large commitment to the team. After the UOTC
						tryouts, certain players will be offered the chance to train and compete on the division 1 team
						based on their skill level on the tennis court. During tryouts, players will be evaluated based
						on their physical and mental skill set. A player’s attitude on and off the court will also be
						factored into this decision.</p>

					<br>
					<h5>Division 1 Player Fee</h5>
					<p>Players can accept or decline this offer to play on the Division 1 team. If a player decides to
						accept their offer, they must then pay a ‘Player Fee’. This fee will be decided by the President
						and Treasurer of the UOTC in collaboration with the Rideau Sports Centre, the local private
						tennis facility. The Player Fee will cover court fees, competition travel, and apparel of that
						Division 1 player for a full fall or winter semester. </p>
					<p>Each player must pay the Player Fee on time, and keep either an electronic or paper record of the
						transaction. The Player Fee is the same for every player regardless of their tennis ability.
						However, the cost can vary per semester based on changes to prime time and/or non-prime time
						courts fees at the Rideau Sports Center. Once the Player Fee is paid, the player will have two
						weeks to decide whether they still want to commit and play on the team.</p>
					<p>If the player chooses to no longer participate on the team within the two-week period, they will
						receive a full refund of their Player Fee. After the two-week period has expired, the player can
						no longer receive a refund of their Player Fee.</p>

					<br>
					<h5>Division 1 Team Practice Commitment</h5>
					<p>Following payment, all Division 1 players must commit to practice. The UOTC will have three
						weekly tennis practices. The dates and times of club practices will be determined by UOTC
						Executives in collaboration with the team captains, Division 1 players, and court availability.
						All players will be notified of practice dates and times as soon as possible. Practices will be
						run by Tennis Canada certified coach and UOTC veteran Zhenya Kondratovski. Zhenya is a former
						top-ranked USSR junior tennis player. UOTC men’s and women’s captains will assist Coach Zhenya
						run practice when necessary.
						Practices will focus on the improvement and development of Division 1 players’ tennis skills.
						Practices will include drills, specific point situations, and match-play.</p>

					<br>
					<h5>Practice Arrival Time</h5>
					<p>Attending practice is mandatory for all Division 1 tennis players. Players are expected to arrive
						five to ten minutes prior to the start of practice. For example, if practice is scheduled at
						7:00am, players should aim to arrive at 6:50am, and change into tennis gear, shoes, etc. by
						6:55am. This will allow practice to begin on-time, every time. Players arriving early should
						also warm up their bodies in order to minimize physical injury during practice. Captains are
						expected to arrive before the players and lead a physical warmup prior to the start of play.
					</p>
					<p>Being late is defined as arriving any time after the first five minutes of practice. Therefore,
						if practice is scheduled at 7:00am and a player arrives at 7:05am, they are considered late. It
						is each player’s responsibility to notify their respective male or female captain whether they
						are unable to attend. Arriving to practice late or failing to attend practice without
						justification will result in consequences for the player.</p>

					<br>
					<h5>Consequences for Lateness</h5>
					<p>It is the player’s responsibility to make any necessary arrangements in order to arrive at
						practice on time. </p>
					<p>With regards to timeliness, the first time a player shows up late will result in a warning from
						their captain. The player will be allowed to join practice when they arrive. A second late
						arrival will result in the player having to wait until their captain deems it appropriate for
						them to join the practice. Any further late arrivals for the player will result in them not
						being allowed to participate in practice. Therefore, the player will be considered absent from
						the practice.</p>
					<p>With regards to absences from practice, any absence from practice that has been justified will
						not result in any penalty for the player; no matter the number of justified absences.
						Justifiable absences can include personal reasons, midterm examinations, class lectures,
						laboratory classes, university trips, and physical or mental injury. However, captains can also
						decide whether or not the player’s justification was appropriate. </p>

					<br>
					<h5>Absence Justification</h5>
					<p>Players have 24 hours prior to practice to justify their absence to their captain. For example,
						if a player was unable to attend a 7:00am to 9:00am practice Monday morning due to the fact that
						he/she had a midterm that same Monday morning at 8:30am, that player has until Tuesday morning
						at 7:00am to notify their captain justifying their absence. It is suggested players justify
						their absence as early as possible. To clarify, justifying an absence is defined as the player
						notifying their captain within 24 hours of the most recent practice that he/she cannot attend a
						practice for the following date due to one or more of the reasons listed above. An absence is
						then deemed unjustified if the respective captain receives a notification beyond the 24-hour
						time limit or no notification from the player at all. </p>
					<p>With regards to unjustified absences, if a player misses practice, doesn’t notify their captain
						on time with their justification, and then arrives at the next practice, it becomes the
						captain’s decision whether the player can participate in that respective practice. </p>

					<br>
					<h5>Consequences for Three or More Unjustified Absences</h5>
					<p>If a player has three or more unjustified absences, they will no longer be considered part of the
						Division 1 team. The player no longer is allowed to attend Division 1 practices, and the player
						will lose the opportunity to compete against other universities with the Division 1 team. The
						player will not receive a refund of their Player Fee. The player may then choose to participate
						in Division 2 practices or wait until the following semester to re-join Division 1 if he/she
						wishes to do so. </p>
